SliTaz Secure File Storage
===============================================================================


Ssfs is a personnal and secure, fast and light online file storage powered by
SSH, Rsync, Lsyncd and SHell script. It monitor a local folder and automaticaly
synchronize the remote server, when files are tranfert they are compressed and
encrypted with SSH. Connection to the remote host is automate with a RSA key,
and for each client the key must be sent to the server via SSH password login.

Using ssfs let you have a live synchronized and secure folder between many
computers with an online copy on a secure Linux server. But even without
connections you have access to your files. Connection to the remote server
can also be done using the command line and 'ssh' from any clients such as
BSD, Android, OSX or Windows via Putty.

Ssfs is very easy to install, setup and configure to make you own secure online
file storage. It provide a cmdline tool for the client and the server with a
build in help, this README is also a howto in itself.

On the server side admin can choose by creating standard accounts or chrooted
accounts wich enforce server security by restricting available commands in a
minimal chroot environment. User $HOME should be set to 0700 so users can't see
other users files.


Installation
------------
To work you need an SSH client, 'rsync' and 'lsyncd' installed, on SliTaz you
can simply install ssfs and it dependencies or to 'make install' from the
source directory (see the Development section). To get a list of commands with
a sort description:


Client help and setup
---------------------
The cmdline interface ssfs let you setup a client and start the daemon and live
synchronization with your system session via the Window Manager autostart
script or your personnal ~/.profile file.

$ ssfs help

To setup a client by creating a Lua configuration file and sending the RSA key
to the server, you can use the command 'setup'. Setup needs a login name and
server name or IP adress and it will also create a secure RSA if no existing:

$ ssfs setup --login=user --host=server


GUI & Web interface
-------------------
Actually they is no frontend or web interface, but it should be just a matter
of free time!


Get configs on boot
-------------------
Ssfs can be used in a boot scripts to connect to remote host and retrive data
before user session is started. It can be usful to provide persitent data for
Live systems and web boot.


Server setup
------------
On the server you must have a SSH server running and an user account with a
~/Sync folder. If you want to create a chroot for users you can use use the
tool ssfs-server. Here is a short example to create a chroot and create a user
login 'tux-sync' with a protected $HOME in the chroot, the root directory can
be specified on the command line or changed in the configuration file:

# ssfs-server gen-chroot
# ssfs-server adduser --login=tux-sync --id=2000 --pass=tuX0cc

Users can be listed or completely deleted including all file in home. More
information with: ssfs-server usage


Server users config
-------------------
When adding a user with 'ssfs-server adduser', the user is added to the host
/etc/passwd and a custom user config file is created in SSFS_USERS with the
login name. Actually the config file have unused variables but here in futur
prevision: PUBLIC="HTTP Public directory"


Development and Bugs
--------------------
If you want to install latest code to test and help in developement you can
clone ssfs Mercurial repository. As usual cose folloy SliTaz light philosofy
with speed and security in mind:

 $ hg clone http://hg.slitaz.org/ssfs

Install with 'make install' (DESTDIR is supported for packaging), update POT
file if any new string have been added with 'make pot' and merger PO files with
the command 'make msgmerge'. Any ideas are welcome and can be discuss, if you
are searching for something to do you can have a look to the TODO file :-)

Bugs can be reported on SliTaz mailing list, forum or scn since devel forum is
synced, all sites are liked from the main website at: http://www.slitaz.org/
