SliTaz Secure File Storage
===============================================================================


Ssfs is personal, secure, fast and light online file storage powered by
SSH, Rsync, Lsyncd and SHell script. It monitors a local folder and automatically
synchronizes the remote server. When files are transferred they are compressed and
encrypted with SSH. Connections to the remote host are automated with a RSA key,
and for each client the key must be sent to the server via a SSH password login.

Using ssfs lets you have a live synchronized and secure folder between many
computers with an online copy on a secure Linux server. But even without any
connections you have access to your files. Connections to the remote server
can also be done using the command line and 'ssh' from any clients such as
BSD, Android, OSX or Windows via Putty.

Ssfs is very easy to install, setup and configure to make your own secure online
file storage. It provides a cmdline tool for the client and the server with a
built in help. This README is also a howto in itself.

On the server side admin can choose by creating standard accounts or chrooted
accounts which enforce server security by restricting available commands in a
minimal chroot environment. User $HOME should be set to 0700 so users can't see
other users files.


Installation
------------
To work you need a SSH client, 'rsync' and 'lsyncd' installed. On SliTaz you
can simply install ssfs and it's dependencies or 'make install' from the
source directory (see the Development section). 


Client help and setup
---------------------
The cmdline interface ssfs lets you setup a client and start the daemon and
synchronize live with your system session via the Window Manager autostart
script or your personal ~/.profile file. To get a list of commands with
a short description:

$ ssfs help

To setup a client by creating a Lua configuration file and sending the RSA key
to the server, you can use the command 'setup'. Setup needs a login name and
server name or IP address and it will also create a secure RSA if none exists:

$ ssfs setup --login=user --host=server


GUI & Web interface
-------------------
Actually there is a small GTK/Yad but no web interface. The tool ssfs-box will
display info if a configuration file exists or start the setup box.


Get configs on boot
-------------------
Ssfs can be used in a boot scripts to connect to a remote host and retrieve data
before a user session is started. It can be useful to provide persistent data for
Live systems and web boot.


Server setup
------------
On the server you must have a SSH server running and an user account with a
~/Sync folder. If you want to create a chroot for users you can use the
tool ssfs-server. Here is a short example to create a chroot and create a user
login 'tux-sync' with a protected $HOME in the chroot. The root directory can
be specified on the command line or changed in the configuration file:

# ssfs-server gen-chroot
# ssfs-server adduser --login=tux-sync --id=2000 --pass=tuX0cc

Users can be listed or completely deleted including all files in home. More
information can be found with: ssfs-server usage


Server users config
-------------------
When adding a user with 'ssfs-server adduser', the user is added to the host
/etc/passwd and a custom user config file is created in SSFS_USERS with the
login name.


Development and Bugs
--------------------
If you want to install the latest code to test and help in development you can
clone the ssfs Mercurial repository. As usual, closely follow the SliTaz light 
philosophy with speed and security in mind:

 $ hg clone http://hg.slitaz.org/ssfs

Install with 'make install' (DESTDIR is supported for packaging), update the POT
file if any new strings have been added with 'make pot', and merger PO files with
the command 'make msgmerge'. Any ideas are welcome and can be discussed. If you
are searching for something to do you can have a look to the TODO file :-)

Bugs can be reported on the SliTaz mailing list, forum or scn since the devel forum 
is synced. All sites are liked from the main website at: http://www.slitaz.org/
